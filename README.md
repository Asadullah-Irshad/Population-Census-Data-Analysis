# UK-Population-Census-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes census data from the UK to gain insights into population demographics, migration patterns, age distributions, and other key factors affecting society. The goal is to explore and visualize trends in the population, identifying patterns and helping to inform public policy and social understanding.

## Required Libraries
This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `csv`: For reading and writing CSV files.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `missingno`: For visualizing missing data patterns.

To install these libraries, you can use the following:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas missingno

## How to Run the Notebook

You can run the notebook in the following ways:

### Option 1: Run Locally with **Jupyter Notebook**
To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed. You can install it via pip if needed:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas missingno
    ```

3. Download the notebook and dataset to your local machine.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. In the browser window that opens, navigate to the `census_data_analysis.ipynb` file and open it.

6. Run the cells in the notebook to start the analysis.

### Option 2: Run on Google Colab
You can also run this notebook on Google Colab without needing to install anything locally.

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the link below:

2. Upload the dataset (if prompted) to Colab.

3. Run each cell in the notebook to start the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `census_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
- `dataset/`: Folder containing the census data CSV file.
